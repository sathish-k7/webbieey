The first thing that caught my attention was the sleek and compact design of the mouse. It is the perfect size for my hand and fits comfortably in my palm. The silent buttons on this mouse are a game changer. I often work late at night and the loud clicking of my previous mouse would disturb others in the house. With the Logitech M221, I can work silently without disturbing anyone. This feature is also great for those who work in quiet environments or for students who don't want to disturb their classmates while using their laptops in class. The 2.4 GHz USB mini receiver is another great feature of this mouse. It allows for a strong and stable connection between the mouse and my laptop. I have not experienced any lag or disconnection issues, even when using the mouse from a distance. Here are the pros and cons of this product after using it for months: Pros: Sleek and compact design Perfect size Silent Buttons Mini USB Receiver Strong and stable connection", "The mouse is good and handy.

I suggest everyone to buy this product", "I purchased this mouse in July 2022, and it worked well for around six to seven months before the scroll wheel started to jump. When I tried to contact Logitech India in Delhi and Chennai to claim the warranty, I found that they either their numbers did not exist or were temporarily out of service. My next step was to call Amazon, who asked me to write to the seller, which was Appario in my case. Despite being promised a reply within two days, I did not receive any response after writing to them on April 25, 2023, as of today, which is May 5, 2023. My third step was to call Amazon again. While most of the agents assured me of a replacement, they were unable to follow through on their promises. Some took down my details without taking any action, while others disconnected the call abruptly. As per my last call -  Amazon may refunded my money, but it will take 3 to 5 working days. Currently the price of the mouse had increased by Rs. 200 so you may end up facing a loss. Given the amount of time and effort spent trying to resolve the issue, I found this to be an extremely frustrating experience. In my opinion, it would be better to buy products from local stores as they often offer quicker resolutions to such problems. WHY I've given 5 stars.

When I scroll up it takes me up and little bit down also and vice versa.", "It did work well for 5 months but latter become disfunctional. I bought another Mouse Amazon basics in November 23.
