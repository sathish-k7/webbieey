        "top_positive_review": "Back in my college days I have used Abyssus, Death Adder, Kana and Rival. Now after 10 years I have recently started playing Valorant and wanted a decent mouse for a few regular casual sessions. I was planning on something economically priced and choose this one after my recently bought HP M270 gave away. Size is decent and on having a claw grip hand doesn't brush against the pad. Clicks are crisp and RGB lighting through the honeycomb pores is quite eye catching. Mouse wheel could have been better. There are 5 sensitivity setting and each has designated color code assigned to it. Overall a good mouse at that price range.",
        "top_critical_review": "First of all, for the price, this mouse is very good value for money. But, it falls short when it comes to the purpose it's advertised for - gaming. I think it is due to the low polling rate but the mouse feels a bit 'sluggish' (for the lack of a better term) when engaging in fast paced activities. There is also problems with click registration (mostly the right click and it's very rare, not a regular issue but thought I'd mention). Pros 1) The price. As I said, for this price, the mouse is indeed VFM. The features (which I'll talk more about below) you get, and the overall build quality of the product far exceeds it's price range. 2) The build quality. As mentioned above, the build quality in my opinion is one of the best aspects of this mouse. It feels solid in your hand. It's pretty sizeable, and as someone with big hands, it really feels comfortable either with a palming or a claw grip method. 3) The USB cable. I have seen conflicting reviews on here but at least the piece I received has a braided USB cable. 4) The RGB. The software provides you with tons of RGB customisation. It also has different lights for different DPI levels so you know what setting you have changed to in the heat of action. 5) The extra buttons. They're there, they work, and they feel nice. Well placed and easy to use. 6) Ergonomic. The shape makes it very comfortable for long periods of usage. Cons 1) Gaming performance. Despite the high DPI levels it can go to, the polling rate holds it back when it comes to fast paced, precision gaming. I played a bunch of Doom Eternal with it and there were click registration and mouse skipping issues that popped up from time to time. If you're really into FPSes, especially online ones, this product will not meet your needs. It's a shame because otherwise, this mouse is great. 2) The scroll wheel. Flimsy and difficult to click. Overall, this would be a nice addition to a gaming rig if you don't play a lot of FPSes and want a RGB mouse to compliment your other RGB stuff. It would also be wonderful as an everyday mouse given its good build quality and comfortable shape. Unfortunately, it's not good to actually game with. I'm torn because on one hand, I like the majority of the things about this mouse but I just can't overlook the performance. I also have the Redgear Shadow Blade mechanical gaming keyboard and that thing is so good; I wish they had brought the performance of that over to this. It would've been an absolute killer.",
