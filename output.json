        "top_positive_review": "Very good quality printer. You do t need a. Computer to set it up. Easier mobile handling app. Kids enjoy printing on I. One of best quality printer for home or small office with color prints. Photo prints on simple generic A4 sheets are also comparable to chemical quality.",
        "top_critical_review": "Every printer company should take example of this HP Printer and learn not to make products this worse. This is an example of how to make the worst quality printer with the worst connectivity, the worst user interface and no driver available or support. If there was an option to put zero stars I would have preffered that. Worst quality print. Colours spreads on all kind and quality of papers, images are not sharp but blurry and the ink color do not dry even after 2 days. It comes out on your hand. There is no driver available for this printer to support for windows. Installing this printer takes eons and eons of repeated proceedure. I'm sure you will go nuts and cracks. Connectivity: After 4.5 hours of installation finally made to connect with wifi. But guess what after each print you need to manually connect the wifi by using the printer wifi button again for the next print. This is a hectic proceedure. User interface: Example of how not to make a user interface this worse. Understand user experience and please make connectivity and interfaces accordingly. [I have used Brother DCP 300. Its very user friendly. All instructions will be given by the printer including paper stuck, cleaning the head etc. and no need to install special softwares or apps.] But this HP printer asks to install multiple apps and unavailable drivers that hardly works after the tedious installation proceedure. It took me hours to find how to clean the head. Please make UI simple for common people and installation plug and play. Technology has grown so much that please stop using interfaces from 1960's. I regret buying such a printer. Anyone still feel like buying this printer even after reading this review?",

        "top_positive_review": "I have been using HP DJ 1050 for 20 years ( yes, twenty ! ) . It is still working good. Paper try was broken few years ago , still able to use it. Only concern was high cartridge use. Usage has increased, hence wanted to go for new one. Question was, which brand I should go for .. none other than the one which lasted for more than 20 years ! The new HP smart tank 670 printer was my choice.. - It has ink tank expecting lesser printing cost - It can be connected via WiFi and Wifi Direct, no hazzeles of wires . When you use WiFi direct, you don't need a wifi router. Also if needed you can connect via USB ( and I guess via Bluetooth too, eventhough I have not tried to configure it) - It has duplex printing, without manual intervention, lot of paper and effort saving. - Colour Amazon delivery was as expected, dot on the date of delivery. Initially I thought of waiting for HP person to install the printer. However I wanted to give a try before that.  As mentioned in the manual sheet, installed HP smart app in my laptop. And followed evey instruction by the app, starting from removing the safety tapes, cardboard etc inside the printer , filling the ink , installing printer head, etc. to final test print , wifi configuration and all. At every point, app on the laptop says successful or not. It was a super smooth installation without any hic ups. Being an ex IT person helped me or rather gave me a confidence to take a chance to install by my own.  HP installation technician called me to visit next day, which I said not necessary. Today is the 4th day of installation, I have taken nearly 50 pages of print outs , I'm quite happy about my choice !",
        "top_critical_review": "Very useless printer, wifi setup is very complex, and if you change your router or wifi, then you will never be able to setup wifi again, it will be disabled permanently. No online solution is avaiable, I m struggling from last few days, seems I need to call support people now and don't know how much they will charge to fix, or if it will be fixed or not no clue, with one more HP printer I faced same issue, and I had to replace my printer as it is not possible to enable the wifi by technician, as it has to be done as hard reset.",
