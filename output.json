        "top_positive_review": "Back in my college days I have used Abyssus, Death Adder, Kana and Rival. Now after 10 years I have recently started playing Valorant and wanted a decent mouse for a few regular casual sessions. I was planning on something economically priced and choose this one after my recently bought HP M270 gave away. Size is decent and on having a claw grip hand doesn't brush against the pad. Clicks are crisp and RGB lighting through the honeycomb pores is quite eye catching. Mouse wheel could have been better. There are 5 sensitivity setting and each has designated color code assigned to it. Overall a good mouse at that price range.",
        "top_critical_review": "First of all, for the price, this mouse is very good value for money. But, it falls short when it comes to the purpose it's advertised for - gaming. I think it is due to the low polling rate but the mouse feels a bit 'sluggish' (for the lack of a better term) when engaging in fast paced activities. There is also problems with click registration (mostly the right click and it's very rare, not a regular issue but thought I'd mention). Pros 1) The price. As I said, for this price, the mouse is indeed VFM. The features (which I'll talk more about below) you get, and the overall build quality of the product far exceeds it's price range. 2) The build quality. As mentioned above, the build quality in my opinion is one of the best aspects of this mouse. It feels solid in your hand. It's pretty sizeable, and as someone with big hands, it really feels comfortable either with a palming or a claw grip method. 3) The USB cable. I have seen conflicting reviews on here but at least the piece I received has a braided USB cable. 4) The RGB. The software provides you with tons of RGB customisation. It also has different lights for different DPI levels so you know what setting you have changed to in the heat of action. 5) The extra buttons. They're there, they work, and they feel nice. Well placed and easy to use. 6) Ergonomic. The shape makes it very comfortable for long periods of usage. Cons 1) Gaming performance. Despite the high DPI levels it can go to, the polling rate holds it back when it comes to fast paced, precision gaming. I played a bunch of Doom Eternal with it and there were click registration and mouse skipping issues that popped up from time to time. If you're really into FPSes, especially online ones, this product will not meet your needs. It's a shame because otherwise, this mouse is great. 2) The scroll wheel. Flimsy and difficult to click. Overall, this would be a nice addition to a gaming rig if you don't play a lot of FPSes and want a RGB mouse to compliment your other RGB stuff. It would also be wonderful as an everyday mouse given its good build quality and comfortable shape. Unfortunately, it's not good to actually game with. I'm torn because on one hand, I like the majority of the things about this mouse but I just can't overlook the performance. I also have the Redgear Shadow Blade mechanical gaming keyboard and that thing is so good; I wish they had brought the performance of that over to this. It would've been an absolute killer.",

Thirdly, it has a huge problem with connectivity. The very first time I connected it with my laptop it was not working. I had inserted the battery first then connected the receiver inside it. It did not work. I checked the devices in my laptop and it(the mouse) was showing there. I panicked honestly, since I thought I will have to return the product. Later, I tried detaching and attaching the battery and it worked. Hope, people who think this is not working find this info helpful. Also, I have seen people commenting on its auto off feature. So, I am detaching the battery whenever it is not in use beforehand. Lastly, if you can afford \u20b9800-1000, go for other wireless mice. I got this at a discounted price of \u20b9200.

        "top_positive_review": "This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop. Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks. The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor. The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop. This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop. Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect. Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing. Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem. The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price. I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need. The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured. This boots in about 15 seconds. It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with. This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING. I can't sing the praises of this enough. Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine. Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode. This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.",
        "top_critical_review": "Okay, so full disclosure.  I'm a computer repair technician and I bought the base model (Ryzen 3 w/4GB of RAM and a 120GB SSD).  As a technician (meaning someone who can upgrade and repair computers), I'd give this a 3.5/5.  As an end user however, I really don't know who this is supposed to be made for.  It's woefully underpowered and comes with a crippled OS.  If you don't mind those things then there are a lot of cheaper options.  If you DO mind those things then I hope you know what you're doing because it's going to take a LOT of time and effort to get this thing usable. First off, S mode.  It's basically a Chromebook in S mode.  Again, you can get a Chromebook (or even another S mode device) for much cheaper than this so I don't know why you'd choose this one.  Putting that aside however, most people say that you can just get out of S mode and you'll have a normal computer, right?  Well, in THEORY that's true.  In practice however, Windows 10S likes to randomly and inexplicably revert to S mode without warning.  As a technician I see these S mode computers all the time that have reverted back to S mode with no way to go back to Windows 10 Home except to do a complete wipe and reload of the OS.  If you want to PERMANENTLY get out of S Mode, you have to get out of S mode, then download a copy of Windows 10 from the Microsoft website and make a USB flash drive with Windows 10.  Then you have to open up the flash drive, go into the Sources folder and add an ei.cfg file with the following parameters: [EditionID] Home [Channel] Retail Once you do that you can boot from the flash drive, erase the drive, and install Windows 10 Home from scratch.  If you don't add the ei.cfg file it will just reinstall Windows 10S again.  This is not something a normal end user would be able to do, but it's necessary if you want to be able to feel secure that the thing isn't going to just randomly revert back to S mode and become unusable. Secondly, the specs.  4GB of RAM and a 120GB SSD?  Seriously, Acer?  The last time 4GB of RAM was standard on laptops was like 2012.  I could see if this were a $150 computer, but at $366 it should have at LEAST 8GB of RAM and a 250GB SSD.  I upgraded mine to 8GB of RAM, a 500GB NVMe SSD, and a 2TB 2.5\" hard drive.  It's been close to a decade since I've personally owned a computer with a hard drive but it's nice to have that ability.  I also appreciate the fact that they include the mounting hardware and even the screws in a separate bag. Third, the screen.  The screen is okay, but there's a major flaw that took me a while to figure out.  The screen will dim if you unplug the charger and run it on battery.  That's normal, right?  Well what's NOT normal is that AMD has a setting called \"Vari-Bright.\"  If this is turned on and you unplug the computer, the display doesn't just dim but it also loses contrast/color.  It's hard to describe it but it looks like crap.  Unfortunately the AMD Radeon software doesn't get installed through Windows Update and it's not on Acer's website so you have to go directly to AMD in order to download it.  Unfortunately that also means that AMD is going to install the latest drivers on your device, which haven't been tested and certified compatible by Acer.  Chances are it will be fine, but it's always best to use the latest driver from the computer manufacturer (in this case, Acer) rather than going to the chip manufacturer.  There are a million and one potential compatibility problems with new drivers, which is why they need to be tested by the manufacturer, who may update other drivers to compensate.  This isn't possible if you want to turn off \"Vari-Bright\" because you're forced to install the latest drivers from AMD. The next problem is with the keyboard backlight.  It turns off after 30 seconds and it won't turn back on again if you move the mouse.  You MUST touch a key on the keyboard to turn it on again.  There's a setting in the BIOS to disable the keyboard backlight timeout, but it doesn't have any effect.  Speaking of which, this computer shipped with an older BIOS revision (1.10).  I upgraded to the latest BIOS revision (1.11) but it didn't fix the keyboard backlight timeout problem.  Looking online it seems that a LOT of people are having this problem and not only with this model of Acer.  Apparently, Acer doesn't care about this problem.  I almost want to return it for this reason, but I really need another computer so I guess I'll keep it.  If I hadn't been able to resolve the screen brightness problem this would have been going back. The final issue is the battery life.  If all you're doing is reading articles this MIGHT be able to get you 4 hours of battery life.  If you're watching videos or you have a lot of stuff open, you'll be lucky to get 2-3 hours.  I mean, all manufactures overestimate their battery life to make their products look good, but this laptop doesn't last much longer than my 10 year old HP. In conclusion, I stand by my initial statement.  I truly don't know who this computer is for.  If you add the cost of the base computer ($366), plus the 500GB SSD ($60), the RAM ($45), and the 2TB hard drive ($80), you're left with a total cost of $551, and there are a lot better computers out there at that price point.  There's an 11th gen i5 15\" HP laptop on here for $599 with over TWICE the processing power, a 250GB SSD, and 8GB of RAM.  It also has space for a secondary hard drive if you need to upgrade that in the future.  If you're okay with an underpowered laptop (4GB RAM, small SSD) with a crippled OS (Windows 10S) you can get one for $150 and save yourself $200. I mean, I wouldn't call this thing a \"nice\" laptop.  It only has a single USB 3 port (the other two, including the one on the RIGHT side are USB 2.0 - that's right, a technology that debut in April of 2000 which means it's even older than Windows XP!).  It feels cheap/flimsy.  Battery life is mediocre.  It's basically a disposable laptop at a non-disposable price.  If this laptop was $150 - $200 I wouldn't be so critical of it, but whether you're looking for a cheap Chromebook type laptop or you want a real laptop that you can upgrade yourself, you can do so much better by going with something else.  I'm only keeping it because I've put so much time and effort into it and it's easier than returning it and starting over. The only person I can see that this would be suited for would be someone with a very limited budget that wants to be able to upgrade it over time vs. spending the $550 upfront.  But if they knew how to do all this computer stuff, chances are they'd have a better income and therefore a higher budget.  Maybe a student or someone just entering the workforce?  I dunno. I must say though, I'm really liking having a secondary drive in a laptop again.  It helps if I need to wipe it out because I don't have to worry about backing up the data since it's on the second hard drive.  But again, there are other computers with this capability.  If you can afford it, the $599 HP with the 11th gen i5 is a great buy.  I haven't personally purchased that computer but after doing all this, I wish I had.",

Maybe it takes a $300 laptop so I don't have to deal with built in Alexa-enabled something, HP-specific ports, fingerprint scanner, and other stuff I don't want or need. They don't try anything fancy with this one which for me is a positive. Plus it's TKL keyboard which really should be the new norm. Does not have a backlit keyboard which is a slight miss but for the price it's not a huge deal. You can take it out of S-mode easily and remove a lot of the addons and you have yourself a perfectly functional Windows machine. Despite the lower-tier hardware it still starts up very quickly if you make sure you don't have too much bloatware. Sure it's a little slow at times but if you're using it for day to day tasks it should be fine. Battery life seems very good, the laptop is also fairly lightweight as well.

        "top_positive_review": "When did it become so difficult to find an analog watch - you know what I am talking about- a traditional clock face type watch? How disturbing to me that some young people can\u2019t read a watch or clock like this -oh well-  anyways, this watch from OLEVS keeps great time, looks good, and has a big face so it is easy to read for my 60 something husband who does not want to have to put on his reading glasses to see what time it is.  He also showed me the watch band which of course is adjustable in size by easily removing band links which he does always need to do.  He has had many watches over the years with similar bands, but this one has two latches that snap in place instead of just one so the watch band is  extra secure and won\u2019t easily unlatch and  fall off the wrist. Nice feature.  The stainless steel is eye catching. Would definitely purchase again.",
        "top_critical_review": "This is a decent quality watch for the price. Been wearing daily for a few months now. It has maintained its color and been resistant to scratches. The sub dials are a fully functional timer/chronograph. Calendar is great addition. The band is good quality with tight fit. Mine came with a sizing tool which was awesome. Removed 3 links for a perfect fit. Not a big fan of the butterfly latch on the band as it can release when you bend your hand down, but for the look and price, I don't mind. Unfortunately, the other day, I took the family to Lake Tahoe where I slipped into the water at the shore.  It was about a foot deep and soaked my clothes but no big deal. Shortly after I checked the time and saw water on the inside of the glass. I then noticed the reset button for the chronograph had fallen out. I thought it must have been from falling into the water though I couldn't understand how my wrist could have jarred the button out. When I got home, I found the button on the floor in front of the watch box that I keep it in. This means it just randomly fell out. It pushes back in but can be easily removed and the chronograph no longer works at all. The watch still runs but the water doesn't seem to want to dry out. Very disappointed as I really liked this watch. I wanted to contact Olevs about the 12 month quality warranty they claim on Amazon but couldn't find a way to contact them directly on Amazon. No contact info or links. The only options were product and seller feedback. Oh, and an address in China. Not much help. Glad to revise my review if the seller reaches out.",

Very happy with the purchase.",
        "top_critical_review": "After 5 years of good service my old Versa was struggling to keep a charge for 24 hours so I decided to replace it with a Sense 2.  Huge mistake! This device drops to 20% charge in about 12 hours and then requires charging for about 2 hours.  You can wear it during the day or at night, but you really can\u2019t do both unless you set aside a couple of hours for charging. The watch has all sorts of sensors, but they all need to be turned off if you want 12 hours of life.  Searching the message boards this seems common.  I will play with the recommendations Insee there for a couple more days before returning it, but I\u2019m not hopefull. It is inexcusible for a company to try to market a product that falls so short of their written claims!  Avoid Fitbit if you are looking for a smart watch! Update: Turning off things like stress management and a restart apear to have imroved the battery life.  Yesterday it dropped to about 60% including a 40minute walk with the GPS on.  Unfortunately, it won\u2019t charge back to 100% in the time it takes me to shower and dress like my old Versa.  So it is probably a charge twise a day affair rather than the advertized once every 6 days.  As others have remarked, the HR monitor seems to be incredibly inaccurate.  It takes quite a while to react when starting a vigourous exercise and the HR laghs the obvioud signs like heavy breathing by several minutes.  It barely registers exercises like the rowing machine in spite of the evident level of exertion.  On a very steep hill that left me huffing and puffing it barely cracked into the fat burn zone.  For some reason, the weather app has decided to stop working, too.  The Google Maps shows turns that have nothing to do with the route being shown on the phone.  This came and went, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t trust it if I needed to get somewhere.  I\u2019m still quite dissatisfied.  More later\u2026 Well, I did get the weather app to work by turning location services to \u201calways\u201d.  On days I don\u2019t use GPS I can actually charge it during my morning shower and get close to 100%. The heart beat monitor continues to be awful.  My old Versa was often slow to recognize exercise, but the Sense 2 can take 10 minutes to even notice increased heart rate. I started the trial offer on Premium but don\u2019t see anything there that would persuade me to pay for it once the trial period ends. Further update - for some reason, the Sense 2 has begun to mistake driving for bicycling.  Based on it\u2019s claims, I should easily win the tour de france.  Pretty good for an old fat guy\ud83d\ude03 Update after another month.  The charging seems to have sorted itself out enough that I only need to charge once per day.  The GPS IS some sort of random number generator, with the distance for the same exact walk varying by around 30% from day to day.  Very brisk walks often show a slower pace than casual strolls. The Sense has begun to begrudgingly acknowledge my heart is beating during rowing sessions, but is wildly inaccurate.  For the stationary bike it tends to not register anything, then overshoot to ridiculous levels before settling in to reasonable agreement with the HR monitor on the bike. The sleep logging seemed to stop at 14 days even though I have worn the Sense every night for at least 40 days.  I\u2019m not sure I care what my \u201csleep animal\u201d is anyway - is this intended for children, or what??? My next fitness tracker/smart watch will definitely not be Fitbit.  I will miss having 7 or so years of history, but if most of it is bogus, who cares?",

        "top_positive_review": "I recently purchased the Logitech M221 Wireless Mouse and I have been extremely satisfied with my purchase. The first thing that caught my attention was the sleek and compact design of the mouse. It is the perfect size for my hand and fits comfortably in my palm. The silent buttons on this mouse are a game changer. I often work late at night and the loud clicking of my previous mouse would disturb others in the house. With the Logitech M221, I can work silently without disturbing anyone. This feature is also great for those who work in quiet environments or for students who don't want to disturb their classmates while using their laptops in class. The 2.4 GHz USB mini receiver is another great feature of this mouse. It allows for a strong and stable connection between the mouse and my laptop. I have not experienced any lag or disconnection issues, even when using the mouse from a distance. Here are the pros and cons of this product after using it for months: Pros: Sleek and compact design Perfect size Silent Buttons Mini USB Receiver Strong and stable connection",
